# API

Run the database schema on your mysql server. Check DAO.php for db setup.
Place the contents of this repo in the root folder of your web server.

The 1Block server-side is a REST API that must adhere to the following protocol.

These endpoints can reside on a longer URL path, they are shortened to a single word for brevity.

GET      /login
===============

This endpoint will generate a challenge string of the format:

HTTPS:
oneblock://{host}/{path}/login?x={nonce}

HTTP:
oneblock://{host}/{path}/login?x={nonce}&u=1

host = hostname for service
path = URL path to login REST endpoint
nonce = unique 32 char hex string

RETURN:

Header:
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{"challenge":"CHALLENGE_STRING"}


OPTIONS  /login
===============

More recently browsers are checking OPTIONS before a POST. Handle the request and set access control.

headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type


POST     /login
===============

headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type

This endpoint needs to use a Bitcoin library to verify the signature against the public address.
if valid, the address is used to identify the account (or register a new one if applicable.)
It will respond with 200 for success and 403 for invalid. It willreturn a JSON payload of:

{"hasRevoke":1}

or

{"hasRevoke":0, "revokeURL":"URL"}


If this is an existing account hasRevoke will be set to 1. If not, a revokeURL must be
supplied, something like:  "https://host.dom/path/to/setrevoke". The client will then
respond with the revoke information to this endpoint. This happens only for new 


POST     /check
===============

This endpoint is repeatedly checked from the website to see if a successful login has
been completed. If so it sets up the session redirects the user to a logged in page.

===================

This is the endpoint to set the revoke data on a new account. This happens on the first
registration of the ID.
